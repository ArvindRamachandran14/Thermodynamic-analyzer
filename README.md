# Thermodynamic Analyzer (TA)

The TA is an apparatus that is used to study the thermodynamics of direct air capture sorbents

Direct air capture is the process of capturing CO2 from the atmosphere for sequestraion purposes

The TA is controlled by the thermodynamic analyzer controller (TAC), which in our set up is a Raspberry Pi. The software for the TAC can be found at https://github.com/ArvindRamachandran14/TAC

Other software programs that help run experiments on the TA are the TADAQ and the TAGUI which reside on the lab PC
